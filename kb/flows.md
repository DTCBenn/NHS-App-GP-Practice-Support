# Troubleshooting flows (local)

## Flow: “Can’t log in”
Ask:
- Are they failing at login (credentials) or verification (ID)?
- Is it iPhone/Android, and do they get an error message?
Do:
- Signpost NHS login recovery if credentials
- If verification: explain the options and what the practice can/can’t do
Escalate:
- NHS login support if account-specific
- Local digital support lead if repeated pattern across patients

## Flow: “Record not connected”
Ask:
- Are they verified to the correct access level?
- Have they recently changed practice?
Do:
- Confirm practice registration status is stable
- Signpost patient to complete verification / re-check practice selection
Escalate:
- Local system admin / ICB guidance if linkage issue persists
